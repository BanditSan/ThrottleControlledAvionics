##Introduction

TCA is a plugin that enhances the attitude control of a ship by dynamically changing the thrust of its engines. Even with most unbalanced designs TCA maintains stable flight and quick response to user or autopilot input. And optional vertical speed limiter enables precise control over ship's altitude.

##Features

* **Per-vessel configuration** profiles and **custom presets**.
* Support for **multiple** control modules (**cockpits**, pods, probe-cores, etc.)
* Sophisticated **parameter tuning**, both automatic and manual.
* Built-in **altitude and hovering control**.
* Built-in **autopilot to kill horizontal speed**.
* **Engine Modes**: Main, Maneuver, Manual.
* Both the **Toolbar** and the stock **AppLauncher** are supported.
* **In-game** configurable **key binding**.
* **Career mode** integration.

##Acknowledgments:

First of all, many thanks to **qfeys** and **Zenka** for creating the original concept and implementation. Without them TCA would not exist.

And here are the mods whose code and ideas were used in one way or another:
