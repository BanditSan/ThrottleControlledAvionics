unofficial 1.3
-Checks whether engines are ignited or not, so engines that are not yet staged or deactivated buy GUI or actiongroup are unavailable for the calculations.
-Uses an engineWrapper class (from EngineIgnitor suggested by camlost) to support engines of the type ModuleEnginesFX (like RAPIERs) along normal engines.
-Supports parts with multiple engine parts (such as RAPIERs)
-No longer stops looking for engines after finding an SRB.

I hope the problem Beetlecat was having is fixed as well. (Since TCA now detects engines much better)
