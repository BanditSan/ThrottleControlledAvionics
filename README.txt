TODO list:
-fix location help menu button
-fix numbers on angle cuttoff
-add text in the help
-Figuring out and testing of the up/forward direction
-add indicator/button for backwards regime
-Hide the GUI with F2

Optional features:
-make TCA unavailable when there is electricity left. (or even better, is SAS is not turned on, let it drain power a bit)
-Zero vector: let TCA figure out how to break your movement compared to the selected object. 
-Maintain altitude, for VTOL's, use the engines to maintain current altitude.
-Engine powered RCS. Allow for translation when using RCS controls using your (hopefully sideward) engines.
